### ‚ú® **LATEST FEATURE: Magic Link Authentication**

**NEW**: Passwordless authentication now available!
- üîó **Magic Link Login**: Users can sign in with just their email
- üìß **Email Registration**: Create accounts without passwords
- üîí **Secure**: Uses Supabase OTP system for secure authentication
- üéØ **User-Friendly**: No more forgotten passwords
- üì± **Mobile-Friendly**: Perfect for mobile users
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Streamlined authentication process

**How it works:**
1. User enters email address
2. System sends secure magic link via email
3. User clicks link to authenticate instantly
4. Automatic account creation for new users

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced authentication service with Magic Link support
- New MagicLinkModal component with role selection
- Auth callback handler for seamless authentication
- Updated LoginView with Magic Link option
- Maintains backward compatibility with password authentication
